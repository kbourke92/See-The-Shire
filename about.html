            <h1> History</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The Shire was settled by hobbits in the year TA 1601 (Year 1 in Shire-reckoning). The hobbits (who
                originally lived in the Vales of Anduin) had migrated west over the Misty Mountains in the centuries
                before, and lived in Dunland and parts of the depopulated Arnor splinter-realms Cardolan and Rhudaur
                before coming to the Shire. It has been speculated that the hobbits had originally moved west to
                escape
                the evils of Mirkwood, and the shadow of Dol Guldur.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Shire was a part of Arthedain and as such a part of Arnor. The hobbits were granted official
                permission from King Argeleb II at Norbury to settle in the Shire, which had become depopulated in
                the
                Great Plague, and was seen as the King's hunting grounds. The hobbits considered themselves to be
                subjects of the King, and sent contingents of archers to the great battles Arthedain fought against
                the
                Witch-king of Angmar. For reasons unknown, Angmar did not attack the Shire after it conquered
                Arthedain.
                Tales claim that some hobbit bowmen were involved at the Battle of Fornost, though no tales of it
                exist
                in the records of Men. After the fall of Arthedain in TA 1974, the Shire became in effect a free
                land,
                with the Thain's office replacing royal authority.

            <hr>
            <p>
                The Shire's history was mostly peaceful, but as Sauron's return neared evil began to return to
                Eriador. In TA 2747 a band of Orcs led by Golfimbul invaded the Shire and were met and defeated by
                Bandobras Took at the Battle of Greenfields. In TA 2912 White Wolves attacked Eriador during a
                terrible winter, leading to famine and the death of many Hobbits.

            <h3> Geography </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The Brandywine River bounds the Shire from the east. Shire hobbits also live in Buckland, which
                lies east of the river and west of the Hedge protecting Buckland from an invasion from the Old
                Forest; From the north and the west, the Shire has no topographical borders, rather it is bound by
                geographical features such as the Tower Hills.

                The Shire is quite densely populated in certain areas, with many villages and a few towns, but it
                still open enough to allow for wide forested areas and marshes. The total amount of land
                calculated in square miles was 21,400.
